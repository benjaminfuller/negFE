% Preliminary Definitions and Results for negFE

\section{Preliminaries}
In this section we will introduce existing results to help clarify our place in the literature, provide necessary existing definitions to show what we are borrowing and what we build on, and we will provide new definitions in support of our novel results.
\subsection{Previous Results}
It has been shown that universal fuzzy extractors are impossible in the information theoretic setting. 
\subsection{Existing Definitions}
Fuzzy extractors and more
\subsection{New Definitions}
Fuzzy extractors with quasipolynomial advice.
